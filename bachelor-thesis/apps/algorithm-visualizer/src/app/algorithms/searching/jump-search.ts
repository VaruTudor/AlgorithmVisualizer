/**
 * The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some
 * elements in place of searching all elements. For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size n and block (to be jumped)
 * size m. Then we search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]â€¦..arr[km] and so on. Once we find the interval
 * (arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m]), we perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element x.
 * @param array - an array of numbers which is going to be searched
 * @param target - the number being searched for
